## Short Intro
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't account for the responsiveness of my first portfolio, https://melissathw.netlify.app/</p>
<p>So I decided to restart on this little project as a chance to practice my media query skills! :D</p>
<br/>
<p>P.S. I feel my first portfolio is more comprehensive so do check it out (desktop only, please)</p>

## Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜Œ
